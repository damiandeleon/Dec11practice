        <h1><bold>My Name is Damian</bold></h1>
        <p>I am really happy to be here.  It's been a long journey for me to get here.  I started this journey immediately after I graduated high school.  From there, my story has several "chapters" if you will.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>After High School</h2>
        <p>After High School, I honestly had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.  I did know I liked to sing.  I had not really had a chance to sing for other people, so I figured if I'm going to grab the bull by its horns, this is the way to do it!  I am so glad that I did that becuase it took me directly out of my comfort zone and taught me how to be comfortable outside my comfort zone.  The biggest challenge for me was not so much that I was singing, but that I was singing for inmates in prison!  See, I joined a prison ministry with my best friend, Edward.  During the year we would tour all over the United States and perform in maximum and medium security prisons.  It was really an eye-opening experience and one that I will never forget.  I was so surprised while writing this to find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f-dJ5cigTU" target="_blank">Youtube Video</a> of the wife of our Director, who gave her testimony as part of our ministry concert.  It is a truly extraordinary and moving testimony.  This wonderful woman was also a great teacher to me.  She was kind, extremely giving, and very strong.  She struggled with mental illness but desprite that and her age, she ministered to all of the people she could.  I miss her dearly.</p>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <p>You know, college was really never my thing.  I was too eager to start working and making money.  But college was a "requirement" of my mother.  Even though I had no money, I went to college between 1994 - 1999.  I paid my own way.  I had a full time job and a part time job while going to school full time. There was time of 3 years that I was also touring with the prison ministry during the weekends.  
            I was really confused back then on what I wanted to do with my life.  I majored in broadcast journalism.  I realized after the first smester that it wasn't my thing.  I'm not nosy enough to be a journalism, nor was I curious enough.  I changed my major to Psychology, but also realized that Psychology was also not my thing.  I realized later tha tthe reason I chose Psychology was just becusae I was trying to figure myself out.
        </p>
        <p>It took time to decide what I was going to do.  It started with my job at a call center.  I realized that I was a natural leader.  I had this unending desire to take care of people and help them all acheive great things.  I was a great listener.  I could also separate my feelings and coach and discipline when I needed to.  Back in those days, I learned about leadership through books, my peers, and my managers. I then decided to major in busienss.  I didn't ever see myself as a business man.  And thanks to the 80's, people who went into business were often characterized as people who wanted to make money.  
            Although that is true for a lot of people, I quickly learned that people also go into business to change the world or to accomplish a personal goal.  But ultimately it gave me a chance to yet again go outside of my comfort zone and do it just to prove to myself that I could.
